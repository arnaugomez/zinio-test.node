## Stack

- Frontend
  - Typescript
  - React
  - Next.js
  - Chakra UI
- Backend
  - Typescript
  - Node
  - Express
  - Fuzzy search library

I chose the TypeScript programming language because it has an awesome developer experience, thanks to which I have been able to build this project in a day. Using the same language both for the frontend and the backend lets you reuse types and interfaces. Finally, TypeScript's strong typing makes the project more scalable and maintainable.

React and Express were my frameworks of choice because they are the tech stack of Zinio. Moreover, I used Next.js because it adds SEO enhancements and Server Side Rendering / Static Side Rendering on top of React. When building a blog, having a strong SEO is a must.

## Performance improvements and optimizations

Backend:
- Some of the operations, like reading + parsing the JSON file and generating the search results, are very expensive. This is why **I have created my own caching system**. Therefore, if you search for the same word twice, the results will appear much faster the second time around. In a real-world app, I would consider using a dedicated caching system like Redis.
- I used a specific library to implement **fuzzy search** and **weighted search** so that the results in the title take priority over the results in the article's body.

Frontend:
- I used a complex **debouncing system** so that the **real-time search** can be much more efficient. Instead of making an API call every time the user types a letter, only 1 API call is performed in the end.

## Architecture and good practices
- Domain-Driven Design
- SOLID
- Repository pattern
- MVC pattern

## How to use

1. Backend: run `yarn dev` from the root folder of the project
2. Frontend: run `yarn dev` from the root folder of the project
3. Open the browser at [localhost:3000](localhost:3000)
